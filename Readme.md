# ChatGPT app using Langchain and python

In this project we are trying to implemet a chatbot using Langchain and OpenAI.


## Use case - Plugable RAG Appointment Booking ChatBot

We are trying to build a chatbot which can be plugable. Meaning anyone can train an instance of this bot for their personal business brand.
The bot will be able to respond to basic human queries regarding the business, also be able to book an appointment.
By booking an appointment, the app will be able to create an entry in the SQL DB (SQL Alchemy Connection) and store it.
